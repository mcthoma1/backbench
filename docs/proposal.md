## Part 2.2: Summary of the Project

### **Main Idea**
We want to create an AI agent that is able to play blackjack in an efficient manner.

### **Goal**
- Win the game
- Decrease the amount of loss
- Increase the winning rate using AI/ML
- Maximize the winning rate

### **Input**
- The amount of cards
- Counts of each card (e.g., how many aces, kings, etc., are left)

### **Output**
- Optimal actions (e.g., hit, stand, double down, etc.)

### **Application**
The AI agent can be used in:
- Online blackjack games
- Similar environments to test the model and improve its performance

## Part 2.3: AI/ML Algorithms

**Algorithm:**
- **Reinforcement learning with Q-learning for decision-making.**

## Part 2.4: Evaluation Plan

### **Metrics:**
- **Profit/Loss:** How much money I lose or earn over games.
- **Win/Loss Ratio:** How much I win or lose the game based on current information.

### **Reward Function Evaluation:**
- Track how the reward function evolves throughout the game based on the AI agentâ€™s decisions and compare it against optimal strategy.
